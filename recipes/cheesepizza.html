    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball of pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (or marinara sauce)</li>
            <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (optional, for brushing the crust)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano or Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour (for dusting the surface)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat the oven:</h3>
                Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, 
                place it in the oven to heat up as well.</li>
            <li><h3>Prepare the dough:</h3>
                Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out 
                the pizza dough into a 10–12 inch circle (or your preferred thickness).</li>
            <li><h3>Transfer to baking surface:</h3>
                Place the rolled dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, 
                or a floured pizza peel if using a pizza stone.</li>
            <li><h3>Add sauce:</h3>
                Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving about 1/2 inch 
                around the edges for the crust.</li>
            <li><h3>Add cheese:</h3>
                Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce. 
                Add more cheese if you like it extra cheesy.</li>
            <li><h3>Bake the pizza:</h3>
                Bake for 10–14 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese
                is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li><h3>Cool and serve:</h3>
                Let the pizza cool for a couple of minutes, then slice and enjoy!</li>
            
        </ol>
